## Tictactoe
>This was part of one of my Projects in the Ai50 course I have completed recently

>pygame, python, copy, AI50, math
	
My minesweeper uses pygame and GUI to open a new tab,and let the user enjoy playing tictactoe

Language(s) used:
Python

How does the webpage work?
The idea is simple. The user has to run 'python runner.py' in the correct folder in the terminal and a new tab will open as the player starts playing tictactoe

## About AI50
AI50 explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By courseâ€™s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.
It is taught mostly by Brian Yu

Thank you for all AI50.
